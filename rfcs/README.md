# âœ¨ RFCs

We're in the process of writing the following RFCs:

1. `?async fn` notation without trait bounds, including an `async_eval_select` mechanism.
2. `async trait` decls and bounds.
3. `?async trait` decls and bounds, `?const trait` decls and bounds
4. `?const fn` notation, becoming the recommended notation for Rust 2024.

Once those are complete, work should continue towards:

5. "generic" keyword generics, AKA `effect/.do` notation.
